# 🖼️ Decentralized Image Upload and Sharing

A **decentralized alternative to Google Drive**, enabling users to securely upload, store, and share images using **blockchain** and **IPFS**.  
Built with **Solidity**, **React**, and **Sepolia**, this project demonstrates how decentralized file storage and access control can be achieved with smart contracts.

## 🚀 Features

- **🧩 Decentralized Storage:**  
  Store images on **IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)** to ensure immutability and censorship resistance.

- **🔐 Smart Contract Access Control:**  
  Manage ownership, sharing permissions, and access revocation using **Solidity smart contracts** on Ethereum.

- **👥 User Access Management:**  
  Grant or revoke permissions for specific Ethereum addresses to view your uploaded images.

- **💡 Transparent & Secure:**  
  All access permissions and ownership records are **publicly verifiable on the blockchain**.
